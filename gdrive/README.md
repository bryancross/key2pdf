#### Steps to reproduce:
https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/nodejs
- Enable the google drive API
- Setup and download credentials
 - Stored in the `/config` directory as `client_secret.json` (ignored)
- Verified the `quickstart.js` code from the above site works to list files from my user account
- Added the `uploadTextFile()` function
- Changed the auth [scope](https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/web/scopes) to `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
  - This gives the app write access only to files it creates
- Added the `uploadPDF()` function
 - PDFs are currently read from the `/data` directory
 - Right now they are manually specified. Will need to be refactored to read the files from the temp directory
- Added the `shortenUrl()` function to generate a short URL from the ID that comes back from the API
 - Requires the `request` library to send a POST request to the Google URL Shortener API
 - API key for :point_up: is stored in `./config/google-config.json`
 - Right now this copies to the clipboard for testing. Will need to store this URL in the catalog

# Command line history
git init
npm init
git remote add origin https://github.com/tcbyrd/gdrive-test.git
git push -u origin master
npm install googleapis --save
npm install google-auth-library --save
node index.js

# Once I added the new uploadTextFile function,
# I had to remove the Google credentials stored in
# ~/.credentials/drive-nodejs-quickstart.json to
# request the new SCOPES.
# This time it requested a SCOPE with write access
# and the text file generated by the function was
# successfully uploaded
```
